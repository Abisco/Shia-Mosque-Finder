# Shia Mosque Finder ReadMe

This App is in development! Watch this page for more info!

## What is Shia Mosque Finder?
A website to find Shia Mosques, Lectures, Gatherings or Events in your area! Users can use it to keep track of the programs at their favorite mosques 

## How will it work?
The website will ask users (such as yourself!) to add mosques to the database which will then show up on the map. Any Mosque added will need to be accepted by me before showing up. Admin permission can be requested via a form on the website.

## Why are you making this?
During Muharram, Ramadhan, Fatimiyyah, and other important events for Shias, it is often hard to keep track of who is reciting where. Sometimes there will be events that people will not even know about happening in their area, with famous reciters they might be interested in, or there might be a Mosque event that you didn't realize was coming up. This website is being made in order to keep everyone on the same page, and to help organizers of Majaalis and Programs to get the word out about their events.

## Main Features
* Find Mosques in your area
* Get directions to the mosque
* See detailed event breakdowns for mosques
* Become an admin for your mosque (provided you have the permission of the mosque) to add events to the website
* Favourite the mosques you like to attend to receive emails
* Favourite the lecturers you love to listen to, to receive emails or notifications of when they are reciting near you
* Eventually: Mobile apps as well 

## What's the progress on this?
Currently in the planning stage and trying to learn React Native in order to help the process of creating the website and transitioning it to mobile. I am mostly focusing on the design as of now and what needs to be implemented! Estimated Alpha Release: Ramadhan 2017/1438 insh'Allah.

Be sure to keep a look out on the github for information on the heroku for testing!
